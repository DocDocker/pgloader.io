      <description>After having been involved in many migration projects in the last 10 years, I decided to publish the following White Paper in order to share my learnings.
The paper is titled Migrating to PostgreSQL, Tools and Methodology and proposed the Continuous Migration approach. Get the book now:
 Continuous Migration makes it easy to make incremental progress over a period of time, and also to pause and resume the migration work later on, should you need to do that.</description>

      <description>On February the 18th, 2015 I received a pretty interesting mention on Twitter:
@tapoueh thank you for pgloader, it made our migration from mysql to postgresql really easy (~1Tb)
&amp;mdash; CommaFeed (@CommaFeed) February 18, 2015 
Their story follows:
@tapoueh it was almost too easy, I just ran the one-liner and waited for 48 hours. Nothing to change in the app, thanks to hibernate.

      <description>PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2017 PGConf.EU is a unique chance for European PostgreSQL users and developers to catch up, learn, build relationships, get to know each other and consolidate a real network of professionals that use and work with PostgreSQL.
pgloader, your migration companion Migrating data from another RDBMS to PostgreSQL should be really easy. After all it’s all relations and tables and the same data types everywhere or abouts, with text, dates and numbers.</description>
