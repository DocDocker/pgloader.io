The pgloader project is fully Open Source and released under [The PostgreSQL
License](http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/) so that anyone can easily
contribute to the project. The whole project management (issue tracking,
feature proposals, etc) happens on the [pgloader github
page](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader), in public.

Software development may be open, and the result shared with an Open Source
Software licence, but the actual hours of programming are not gratis.

Just like everybody else, I need money for mortgage, kids and food, money I
make by doing things with computers, for people who are willing to pay for
that.

One of the things I do for money, is develop pgloader, and the *pgloader
Moral License* is a good vehicle available for the paperwork. I shamelessly
stole the whole idea from [The Varnish Moral
License](http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/). See the [Varnish Moral License
FAQ](http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/vmlfaq.html) and How To to see how PHK does
it.

Here's what our customer *Andrea Crotti* has to say about using and
sponsoring pgloader:

> Thanks to pgloader we were able to migrate our main database from MySQL to
> Postgres, which involved moving hundreds of tables used by our complex
> Django project. Dimitri was very helpful. He implemented a new feature for
> us quickly and smoothly.

Here's what our customer *Alexander Groth* has to say about using and
sponsoring pgloader:

> [Fusionbox](http://www.fusionbox.com/) used pgloader on a project for a
> large government agency. We needed to migrate a large set of data from an
> existing SQL Server cluster to a new PostgreSQL solution. Pgloader greatly
> reduced the time required to accomplish this complex migration.

## Redpill Linpro

When Redpill Linpro was asked about the most efficient way to migrate from
Microsoft SQL Server to our beloved PostgreSQL by one of their customers,
they asked me to add support for SQL Server in pgloader. Thanks to Redpill
Linpro now everyone can do the same, as the result is Open Source and fully
integrated into pgloader!
